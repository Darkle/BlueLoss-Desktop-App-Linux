## How To Use

When you run BlueLoss, it sits in your system tray and searches for discoverable Bluetooth devices.

#### System Tray Options:

- **Open BlueLoss Settings** This opens the settings/status window

- **Disable BlueLoss**

- **Toggle Tray Icon Color** Toggles the BlueLoss system tray icon color between blue or white

- **Open Logs** This will open the folder where the BlueLoss logs are written to

- **Quit BlueLoss**

#### Adding A Device:

With the BlueLoss settings/status window open, you can now add a device that BlueLoss is supposed to look for in the scan.

BlueLoss scans for discoverable Bluetooth devices once every 30 seconds by default. If the device you have added to look for is not found, and enough time has passed since it was last seen, it will lock the computer BlueLoss is running on. Both the scan interval and the interval between when a device is lost and the computer is locked is configurable in the settings.

#### Settings:

The following settings are configurable in the BlueLoss settings window:

- **Enable/Disable BlueLoss** (default: enabled): You can enable/disable BlueLoss from either the system tray or the status window (see screenshot above).

- **Time To Lock** (default: 2 minutes): This determines how many minutes BlueLoss should wait before locking the computer after a device it's looking for on the network has been lost.

- **Scan Interval** (default: 30 seconds): This determines the interval (in seconds) between scans for nearby Bluetooth devices.

- **Run On System Startup** (default: true) Note: this doesn't work properly for the AppImage - you will need to add it to your system's autorun manually if you are running the AppImage.

- **Error Reporting** (default: true): Any errors generated by BlueLoss will be sent to [Rollbar.com](https://rollbar.com). This helps development of the app.

- **Verbose Logging** (default: disabled): Enabling this will turn on verbose logging. This can help to diagnose issues. You can open your log files via the BlueLoss system tray icon menu.

## Security Info:

BlueLoss searches for devices that are discoverable - this means that the device is currently broadcasting its Bluetooth information. By default most devices don't do this all the time for security reasons.

We get around this with an app on the device that makes it always broadcast its Bluetooth details. Obviously there are security issues with that, so we try to mitigate the risk by only broadcasting when you are in a trusted location (e.g. work/home). Having said that, if you are in need of something that is very secure, Blueloss is probably not for you.

Also, BlueLoss does not pair with the Bluetooth device, it only matches the Bluetooth MAC address. This means you can fool BlueLoss if you spoof a device's MAC address.
